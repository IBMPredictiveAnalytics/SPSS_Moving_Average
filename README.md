To create a moving average:
  1. select any continous field in the '*Values*' selector on which you want to calculate the moving average 
  2. In the Field '*Moving average over periods*' select a period over which the moving average should be calculated
  3. The result is a field that contains the average of the last n periods for each row.

Future updates may contain different moving averages as well as the possibility to derive multiple periods. Feel free to contribute.
